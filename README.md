## Hi, I'm Jeroen. 👋

I'm a Technical consultant with a passion for the newest technologies. I use this passion to gain experience in various areas, such SAPUI5/OpenUI5, SAP Cloud Platform, CPI, CAP, ReactJS, full stack developments, ...

Software engineering is my day to day task but it's not only about writing code, it's about analysing and translating difficult business processes into user friendly applications. This to help people/customers/partners enjoying their day to day tasks as much as I enjoy mine
